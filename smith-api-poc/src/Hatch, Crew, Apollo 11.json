The Saturn V was one of several rockets developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for use in the Apollo program. America's largest operational launch vehicle, a Saturn V first launched a manned Apollo spacecraft in December 1968 when the crew of Apollo 8 were placed into lunar orbit. In July 1969, the rocket sent astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edward Aldrin, Jr. of Apollo 11 to the surface of the moon, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. Saturn V was utilized in the remaining six Apollo missions to the moon during 1969-1972 and to launch the Skylab Orbital Workshop into Earth orbit in May 1973. David Gianakos built this model and donated it to NASM in 1975."

This Command Module, no. 107, manufactured by North American Rockwell, was one of three parts of the complete Apollo spacecraft. The other two parts were the Service Module and the Lunar Module, nicknamed \"Eagle.\" The Service Module contained the main spacecraft propulsion system and consumables while the Lunar Module was the two-person craft used by Armstrong and Aldrin to descend to the Moon's surface on July 20. The Command Module is the only portion of the spacecraft to return to Earth."

When it returned to the United States, it was reunited with its descent stage, modified to appear like the Apollo 11 Lunar Module \"Eagle,\" and transferred to the Smithsonian for display."
